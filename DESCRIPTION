Description: As modern medicine continues to improve and rates of age-related diseases continue to rise, understanding the aging process becomes of paramount importance to human health. Early age-related characterization studies reported dietary restriction as a robust anti-aging intervention that spans the biological hierarchy. Recently, findings in the field of Circadian Biology implicate the circadian clock as a central player in these increased longevity phenotypes. The circadian clock coordinates the cyclic expression of ~40% of genes across all tissues, and is entrained by environmental signals, Zeitgebers, such as light, temperature, and food. Nonetheless, the cause and effect relationship between the clock and dietary restriction-mediated longevity are largely unknown. At the core of elucidating these mechanisms is the ability to detect and compare rhythmicity across conditions in time-course gene expression data. To date, no method has adequately addressed the problem of identifying differentially cycling genes across conditions. We present a topology-based rhythm detection method for gene-expression data designed to identify cycling transcripts and compare their degree of rhythmicity across experimental conditions. For a given time-series, the method reconstructs the state space using time-delay embedding, a data transformation technique for dynamic systems. Takensâ€™ theorem proves that the dynamics of a rhythmic signal will exhibit circular patterns in the embedded space. The degree of circularity of the embedding is calculated as a persistence score using persistent homology, an algebraic method for discerning the topological features of data. By comparing the persistence scores across conditions, the method assesses whether the embedded topological structures differs significantly between phenotypes, thereby quantifying differences in gene expression rhythms.
