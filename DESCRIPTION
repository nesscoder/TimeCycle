Description: TimeCycle is designed to detect rhythmic genes in circadian transcriptomic time-series data. Based on topological data analysis, TimeCycle provides a reliable and efficent reference-free framework for cycle detection --- handling custom sampling schemes, replicates, and missing data. See the TimeCycle website and accompanying paper for more information, documentation, and examples.
